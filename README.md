Rules:
- Write a simple web app that hits the Twitch API URL shown at the top (there are API docs online).
- Build the URL based on the query entered by the user in the search box shown in the mock. Recently, the Twitch API has changed, and the search query must be a complete game name.
- Build out the list as shown in the mock.  
- All UI elements are mandatory and self-explanatory.
- Each list entry should link to the corresponding Twitch stream.
- Feel free to add more/better UI, as long as you include the mandatory elements.
- No frameworks like jQuery/AngularJS.  Just vanilla JS with XHR to hit the API.
 
Submit your code to a GitHub repo and send us the link.  You can host the running app on github.io.
